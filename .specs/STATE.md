## Decisions

### AD-001
- **Decision**: The Chromium instance lives in a `BrowserSession` yielded by the MCP server lifespan and is read by tools from the request's lifespan context; it is never a module-level global.
- **Reason**: The lifespan gives a real shutdown path and binds the browser to the event loop that created it. Each in-memory test client gets its own lifespan, so tests share one browser through one session-scoped client and can reproduce "Chromium not installed" with a second client.
- **Trade-off**: Every tool that needs a browser must take the SDK `Context` parameter.
- **Scope**: `src/squint_mcp/capture.py`, every tool that produces a Capture, `tests/conftest.py`.

### AD-002
- **Decision**: A tool that returns images is annotated `Annotated[CallToolResult, <ResultModel>]` and builds its own result: a text summary, the images as MCP image content blocks, and camelCase structured content. Anticipated failures are raised as `ToolError` with a concrete message; nothing is returned as partial data.
- **Reason**: Image blocks are rendered by clients and are not billed as base64 text; the result model still publishes an output schema. One error channel keeps "the page is broken" apart from "the page is clean".
- **Trade-off**: The handler assembles content blocks by hand instead of returning a model.
- **Scope**: Every tool under `src/squint_mcp/tools/` that returns crops.

### AD-003
- **Decision**: A Capture taken for Checks holds every element of the page (open shadow trees included, in document order) with the same generic fields, among them a selector unique on the page. A Check is a function `Capture -> list[Finding]` in its own module under `src/squint_mcp/checks/`, registered by name in `checks/__init__.py`. Checks hold no page script; the tool, not the Check, orders Findings and allocates crops.
- **Reason**: ADR-0002 makes the Capture the whole contract between browser code and Checks. One generic collector lets a new Check ship as one Python module; selectors need the live DOM, which is gone by the time a Check runs.
- **Trade-off**: Every element is serialized on every `detect_visual_bugs` call, whatever the Checks need. A Check that needs a new fact about an element adds a field to the collector and to `Element`.
- **Scope**: `src/squint_mcp/js/collect_elements.js`, `src/squint_mcp/models.py`, `src/squint_mcp/checks/`, `src/squint_mcp/tools/detect_visual_bugs.py`.

### AD-004
- **Decision**: A Capture carries three pixel layers of the same size: `pixels` (the page as painted), `background` (the page with no text painted) and `ink` (how much text ink each pixel gets, 0 to 255). The two new ones come from screenshots taken with `-webkit-text-fill-color` forced on every element: transparent for `background`, black and white for `ink`, which is the difference of the two. A Check tells text from what is behind it through these layers, never by guessing from `pixels`.
- **Reason**: Anti-aliased edges, clipped text, covered text and text of the colour of its background all make "the pixels inside the text's box" wrong as a background. The fill property changes glyphs only; `color` would also repaint borders, underlines and shadows. Spiked against real Chromium for slice 4.
- **Trade-off**: Four screenshots per Capture instead of one, for every tool. Text whose fill cannot be forced has no ink.
- **Scope**: `src/squint_mcp/capture.py`, `src/squint_mcp/js/fill_text.js`, `src/squint_mcp/models.py`, every Check that reads text pixels.

## Handoff

- **Feature**: `capture-pixel-budget` (roadmap slice 6, issue #11) / `.specs/features/capture-pixel-budget/`
- **Phase / Task**: Build, with `tlc-spec-lean` at profile `light`. The plan is approved by the maintainer; `checks.md` has C1 to C15.
- **Completed**: plan, checks, the two fixtures, the tests of C1 to C11 written from the checks, the implementation (`vision.py`, `checks/low_contrast_real.py`, `config.py`), the CHANGELOG entry. `pyright`, `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` are green.
- **In-progress** (file:line): the whole suite (C15) was started after the implementation and had not finished when the session was paused. Before the implementation the new tests of C1 and C7 failed and the others passed.
- **Next step**: run `uv run pytest`; fix what is red without touching an assertion; then dispatch a fresh Verifier over `f2c6213..HEAD` with every check (`references/verify.md` of the skill), and run `validate_verification.py capture-pixel-budget`. After that: roadmap slice 6 to `concluída`, the task record, and the pull request, which closes issue #11.
- **Blockers**: none. The branch is local until the maintainer says to push it.
- **Uncommitted files**: none
- **Branch**: `feat/capture-pixel-budget`
