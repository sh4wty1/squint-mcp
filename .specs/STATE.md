## Decisions

### AD-001
- **Decision**: The Chromium instance lives in a `BrowserSession` yielded by the MCP server lifespan and is read by tools from the request's lifespan context; it is never a module-level global.
- **Reason**: The lifespan gives a real shutdown path and binds the browser to the event loop that created it. Each in-memory test client gets its own lifespan, so tests share one browser through one session-scoped client and can reproduce "Chromium not installed" with a second client.
- **Trade-off**: Every tool that needs a browser must take the SDK `Context` parameter.
- **Scope**: `src/squint_mcp/capture.py`, every tool that produces a Capture, `tests/conftest.py`.

- **Status**: active

### AD-002
- **Decision**: A tool that returns images is annotated `Annotated[CallToolResult, <ResultModel>]` and builds its own result: a text summary, the images as MCP image content blocks, and camelCase structured content. Anticipated failures are raised as `ToolError` with a concrete message; nothing is returned as partial data.
- **Reason**: Image blocks are rendered by clients and are not billed as base64 text; the result model still publishes an output schema. One error channel keeps "the page is broken" apart from "the page is clean".
- **Trade-off**: The handler assembles content blocks by hand instead of returning a model.
- **Scope**: Every tool under `src/squint_mcp/tools/` that returns crops.

### AD-003
- **Decision**: A Capture taken for Checks holds every element of the page (open shadow trees included, in document order) with the same generic fields, among them a selector unique on the page. A Check is a function `Capture -> list[Finding]` in its own module under `src/squint_mcp/checks/`, registered by name in `checks/__init__.py`. Checks hold no page script; the tool, not the Check, orders Findings and allocates crops.
- **Reason**: ADR-0002 makes the Capture the whole contract between browser code and Checks. One generic collector lets a new Check ship as one Python module; selectors need the live DOM, which is gone by the time a Check runs.
- **Trade-off**: Every element is serialized on every `detect_visual_bugs` call, whatever the Checks need. A Check that needs a new fact about an element adds a field to the collector and to `Element`.
- **Scope**: `src/squint_mcp/js/collect_elements.js`, `src/squint_mcp/models.py`, `src/squint_mcp/checks/`, `src/squint_mcp/tools/detect_visual_bugs.py`.

## Handoff

- **Feature**: `detect-visual-bugs-text-clipped` (roadmap slice 3) / `.specs/features/detect-visual-bugs-text-clipped/`
- **Phase / Task**: Tasks approved (`tasks.md`, 9 tasks in 3 phases). Execute starts at T1; no production code written yet.
- **Completed**: Specify (70 requirements, `validate_spec.py` clean), discuss (`context.md`), Design (`design.md`, AD-003), Tasks (`tasks.md`, `validate_tasks.py` clean). Baseline: 61 tests pass.
- **In-progress** (file:line): none.
- **Next step**: Execute from T1, inline (the maintainer was advised against sub-agents: the second batch is one documentation task). The Verifier runs after T9.
- **Blockers**: none locally: the fix of issue #5 is merged into this branch from `fix/box-model-layout-content`. PR #6 itself is still open: GitHub answered 500 to every merge attempt on 2026-10-07.
- **Uncommitted files**: none
- **Branch**: `feat/detect-visual-bugs-text-clipped`
